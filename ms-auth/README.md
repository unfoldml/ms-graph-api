## Introduction

This library provides helpers for building token-based authentication flows e.g. Client Credentials (App-only) and On-Behalf-Of (Delegated), as well as for keeping tokens up to date in the background.


## Status

This library is functional but still in development.

## Evolution of the library

Some breaking changes might also be introduced as the library matures.

We adhere to a simplified version of the [Package Versioning Policy](https://pvp.haskell.org/): breaking changes are signaled by increasing the major version number (e.g. 0.x -> 1.x ).
