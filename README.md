## Description

This library provides both the client interface and authorization infrastructure to integrate with Microsoft infrastructure, e.g. using ActiveDirectory as an OAuth2 identity provider.

## Status

This library is still in development, so expect missing funcionality.
If there's anything you would like to see added, feel free to
[open an issue](https://github.com/unfoldml/ms-graph-api/issues/new).
Some breaking changes might also be introduced as the library matures.
