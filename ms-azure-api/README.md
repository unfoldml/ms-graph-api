## Introduction

This library provides the client interface (under the `MSAzureAPI` namespace).

Authentication can be implemented with the @ms-auth@ library.

## Status

This library is still in development, so expect missing functionality.
If there's anything you would like to see added, feel free to
[open an issue](https://github.com/unfoldml/ms-graph-api/issues/new).
In general, since the MS Azure API is quite large, features will be added to this library on a need basis.

## Evolution of the library

Some breaking changes might also be introduced as the library matures.

We adhere to a simplified version of the [Package Versioning Policy](https://pvp.haskell.org/): breaking changes are signaled by increasing the major version number (e.g. 0.x -> 1.x ).
